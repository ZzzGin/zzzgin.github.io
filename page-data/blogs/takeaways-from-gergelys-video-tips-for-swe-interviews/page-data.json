Thus, if you use these functions, you cannot also use pins 0 and 1 for digital input or output.\n* I2C\n    * Inter-Integrated-Circuit is a bus-based serial communication **protocal** that happens using two signal pins: SDA(data signal) and SCL (clock signal)\n    * This protocol allows you to connect several devices to the same lines (SDA and SCL) and each device is selected by calling its unique address identifier.\n\n### IDE\n![arduino ide](images/1592989171-aek-ch2-sc2-1-parts-of-ide.jpeg)\n* Special functions in Sketch Editor\n    * `setup()`: called once, when the sketch starts\n    * `loop()`: called over and over and is heart of most sketches\n* Verify means compiling\n\n### Arduino Nano Motor Carrier\n![motor carrier](images/1592989128-aekch2sc2-1nanomtrcarrier.jpeg)\n> The Arduino Nano Motor Carrier is compatible with all the boards from the Arduino Nano Family\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| ------- | ----------- |\n|Microcontroller | ATSAMD11 ( Arm Cortex-M0+ @48 Mhz)|\n|Max Input voltage (power terminals) | 4V (1S Li-Ion Battery)|\n|Max output current per motor driver | 1 Amp|\n|Motor driver output voltage | 12V|\n|Over Temperature shutdown protection (for DC motor drivers) | Yes|\n|Battery type | Li-ion battery (1S)|\n|Battery charging | Yes|\n|Max battery charging current | 500mA (configurable)|\n|Power terminals (connectors) | XT-30 and 2POS terminal block|\n|Interface | Terminal block and 3 pin/4 pin header connector|\n|Servo connector | 4 terminals|\n|Stepper connector | 2 terminal|\n|Encoder inputs | 2 ports|\n|DC motor control | 4 ports|\n|3V digital/analog sensor input/output | 4 ports|\n|IMU | BNO055 9axis Accelerometer / Gyroscope/ Magnetometer|\n\n![features-1](images/1592989109-aekch2sc2-1mtrcrrmotordrivers.png)\n* The SAMD11 Microcontroller\n    * The SAMD11 is used to control the servos, read values from the encoders, and read the battery voltage in an autonomous way. \n    * This microcontroller receives commands and send information to the Arduino Nano 33 IoT via I2C.\n* Servo Outputs\n    * The Servo pins handle all the communications between the servos and the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. \n    * Accessing the connected servos can be easily done with their corresponding Servo objects Servo1, Servo2, Servo3 and Servo4 from the IDE.\n* DC Motor Outputs\n    * The DC motor terminal pins are used to connect any DC motor to the Carrier board. \n    * There are 4 terminals, M1, M2, M3 & M4, marked with a +ve and -ve sign. You can connect 4 DC motors at the same time but there are only 2 encoder inputs. \n    * The polarity signs signifies the direction of rotation of the connected motors.\n* DC Motor Drivers\n    * The Motor Carrier features 4 motor drivers for high-performance DC motor control with direct connection to the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Each driver allows you to control one DC Motor. \n    * The DC motors are connected to the Arduino Nano Motor Carrier using the blue connectors (terminal blocks) on each side of the board. \n    * The motors have to be connected in the pins that are labeled (M1+ M1-, M2+ M2-, M3+ M3- and M4+ M4-).\n* Encoder Inputs\n    * These terminal blocks adjacent to the DC motor terminals can be used to read the encoder values from the attached DC motors through the terminals HA1-HB1 & HA2-HB2.\n\n![features-2](images/1592989140-aek-ch2-sc2-1-mtr-crr-ext-pwrsource.jpeg)\n* Lipo Battery Connector\n    * When working with motors, you will need an external source to feed the motor drivers and power up the motors. You can do this by connecting a LiPo Battery to the battery connector.\n* Boost Convertor\n    * A boost converter is a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage from its input to its output.\n* External Power Connector\n    * Other external power sources can be connected to the VIN input on the terminal block.\n\n![features-3](images/1592989112-aekch2sc2-1mtrcrrsensors.jpeg)\n* Analog Inputs\n    * The carrier board also comes with 4 analog connectors used for connecting 3 pin analog sensors to the carrier board. These connectors are connected to the analog pins A2, 3, 7 and 6.\n* IMU Sensor\n    * This carrier features the BN0055, a 9-axis (acc+gyro+magnetometer) orientation sensor. \n    * This IMU (Inertial measurement unit) module can measure how the carrier board behaves under changes in linear acceleration, angular rotation, and, in some cases, the magnetic field around the module.\n\n![features-4](images/1592989144-aek-ch2-sc2-1-mtr-crr-leds.jpeg)\n* Motor LED : This led indicates which motors are on and which directions they are spinning.\n* Signal Fault LED : This lights up when there's a fault condition in the driver due to over current or over temperature.\n* On LED : This LED signals when the board is powered.\n* UI LED : User interface LED usually lights up when there is a problem with the library version that is incompatible with firmware version.\n* BAT LED : The Battery LED Lights up when the battery is being charged.\n\n![use carrier](images/1592989125-aekch2sc2-1nanomtrcarrierattached.jpeg)\n* Plug in Nan 33 IoT to Motor Carrier.\n    * Some of pins will stop being available because they will be needed to control some of the features of the Carrier\n        * Digital pin D2 for IN2 signal for Motor3\n        * Digital pin D3 for IN1 signal for Motor3\n        * Digital pin D4 for IN2 signal for Motor4\n        * Digital pin D5 for IN1 signal for Motor4\n        * Digital pin D6 for Interrupt signal from the SAMD11 to the Arduino Nano 33 IoT\n        * Digital pin A4/SDA for the SDA signal (I2C)\n        * Digital pin A5/SCL for the SCL signal (I2C)\n    * to control the motors, need to import the Arduino nano Motor Carrier Library: [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinomotorcarrier/)\n    * [How to install library](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries)\n* Charging the Battery\n    * Prerequisites:\n        * The Arduino Nano 33 IoT Board is connected to the Arduino Nano Motor Carrier,\n        * The Arduino Nano 33 IoT Board is connected to the power source via the USB,\n        * The power switch on the Arduino Nano Motor Carrier is On.\n    \n## Matlab\n* If you want to simply execute a line of code without seeing the result in the Command Window, you can end the line with a semicolon `;`.\n* In MATLAB, the **size** of a variable indicates its dimensions, in a rows x columns format.\n* Variables with 1x1 as its size is called **scalar**;\n* **Vector** is one-dimentional array.\n    * `v1 = [1 3 2 6 4 4 9]` creates vector of one row\n    * `v2 = [2;5;7;1;2]` creates vector of one column\n* You can reorient a vector as a column or row using the transpose operator (`'`): `v2 = v2'`\n* vector can be generated by `({start}:{step}:{end})`\n* **Vectorization** is a key feature of the MATLAB language, and it allows you to write simple, concise lines of code that execute many operations at once, and which closely resemble mathematical expressions.\n* `arduinosetup` to load necessary library into Arduino board\n* `a = arduino` to establish the connection with Arduino Nano 33 IoT\n\n## Simulink\n* Source > Sine Wave: a block functions as signal source\n    * ![sine wave](images/WeChat45206e8c2fbec1c557714bbbf8cd2f41.png)\n* Continuous > Transfer Fcn: a block that continuously modifies that signal\n    * ![transfer fcn](images/WeChatceca91bec75db82399d29eddb6245ce1.png)\n* Sink > Scope: \n    * Notice that these blocks generally have an inward triangular port on their left, known as an import\n    * Block imports allow you to Terminate a signal.\n* Connected these 3 blocks:\n    * ![connected](images/WeChate4c7e39bd929b3282f57cb4c8654314b.png)\n* Configurations can be applied by double clicking the blocks\n    * ![configured](images/WeChata75bbb331f531af6bed2692fd5bccf7e.png)\n* \"Run\" and we can see the output by double clicking Scope\n    * ![scope outout](images/WeChatc9c22cad8583eaa1eec14f3fc200ac35.png)\n* Blocks and Links can be labeled\n    * ![labeled](images/WeChatf0e39de67bfe6dd76882fb9fc3716307.png)\n* Currently, this simulation is running in **continuous** mode.
