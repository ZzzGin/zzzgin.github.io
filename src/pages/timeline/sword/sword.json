While he later posted that it was due to “technical difficulties,” most people understand it as having triggered government censors, who interpreted it as a reference to the anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Li isn’t known to have been arrested, and his account remains active, but he hasn’t streamed or posted on social media since that day. Fans and observers suspect he may not be allowed to stream again. ",

Earlier in the day, he shot his grandmother in the forehead at home, severely wounding her. Outside the school, he fired shots for approximately five minutes[4] before entering unobstructed with an AR-15 style rifle through an unlocked side-entrance door. He then locked himself inside two adjoining classrooms, killed nineteen students and two teachers, and remained there for more than an hour before members of a United States Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) fatally shot him.[5] The shooting was the third-deadliest school shooting in the United States, after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012,[6] and the deadliest in Texas.[7]",
