If the cdf $P$ is **strictly monotonically increasing**, it has an inverse, called the **inverse cdf**, or **percent point function (ppf)**, or **quantile function**.

$$\mathbb[\sum^n_{i=1}X_i]=\sum^n_{i=1}\mathbb{V}[X_i]$$

$$
p(H=h|Y=y)=\dfrac{p(H=h)p(Y=y|H=h)}{p(Y=y)} \\
p(h|y)p(y)=p(h)p(y|h)=p(h,y)
